# github-backup
Python script to clone all repos in an organization and pull all remote branches  

## Requirements  
You will need git installed and a github account with access to the organization's repos.  

## Use  
Specify your username and organization in the appropriate variables. If you need to, you
can supply your proxy and port too.  

Running the script ```python github_backup.py``` you will be prompted to enter your github 
account password. The script will create a new folder labelled by the date and then clone 
all repos into here, pulling all remote branches at the same time.
